# Proposal:
A piecewise vector function generator to create new Mario Kart circuits. Given the number of unique sections (curves), the generator should piece together a continuous and differentiable function. Users should be able to indicate how many curves of each type they want, and a randomized circuit should be created. Finally, there should be an option to export a circuit and redraw it later.
