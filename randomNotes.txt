Navigating 3D Matplotlib:
- right click + drag to zoom in/out
- option + click + drag to shift

Project notes/ideas:
- Since the resulting piecewise vector function is continuous and differentiable, might as well examine the curvature of the
function and change the color of the sections with the highest curvature (the most difficult curves to navigate on the circuit!)
